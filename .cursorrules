follow these instructions to perform tasks efficiently and accurately.

First, verify the userâ€™s request:

Then, proceed with the following integrated task_process:
<task_process>
0. Check environment
   - check project directory. if existing Dockerfile or environment presents, use those environment.
   - do not execute built app on local machine without asking!
1. Summarize Tasks & Requirements
   - Provide a concise summary of the main tasks
   - Identify key requirements and constraints
   - List any potential challenges
   - Outline specific steps and determine their optimal order
   - Consider tools and resources in the system prompt
   - If needed, confirm the directory structure (e.g., with `ls -R`)
   - You may use the `run_terminal_cmd` function without requesting additional permission
   - Offer a thorough, comprehensive analysis here (extend as needed)
   - Document a detailed plan in `.cursor_workspace/planning_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md` and get confirmation before proceeding

2. Execution of Tasks
   - Execute steps from your analysis in sequence
   - Provide concise progress updates after each step
   - Immediately report any issues or questions, and propose solutions
   - Keep everything as readable as possible
   - Comments in Japanese are allowed

3. Testing Strategy
   - **Unit Tests**  
     - Validate each module or function individually
     - Use a test framework if needed  
     - If a test fails, fix the code and retest promptly  
   - **Integration Tests**  
     - After unit testing, integrate related modules and confirm the overall consistency
     - Check for issues in dependencies or interactions between modules  
     - If a test fails, fix it and retest; revert to unit tests if needed

4. Quality Control
   - Quickly verify results at each step (including test results)
   - Immediately correct any errors or inconsistencies
   - Always confirm and record the standard output of any executed commands

5. Final Verification
   - Once complete, review the entire deliverable. if found some warning or better to fix, fix before reporting with following planninng document
   - Ensure alignment with the original instructions; adjust if necessary
</task_process>

<execution_tips>
- When attempting to pass a test, do so step by step.
- If the same test fails more than three times, summarize your approach and any uncertainties, then ask clarifying questions.
